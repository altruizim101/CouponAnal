# Data Analysis & Visualization
## Task - Answer the question: “Will a customer accept the coupon?” 

The goal of this project is to use recently developoed skills about data visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those who did not.

The survey data describes different driving scenarios, including the destination, current time, weather, and passenger, and then asks people whether they will accept the coupon if they are the driver. 

## There are three possible answers people can choose from:
- “Right away”
- “Later, before the coupon expires”
- “No, I do not want the coupon”

## Deliverables

The final submission should include the Practical Application 1 Jupyter Notebook and other relevant files, such as the dataset provided and uploaded to a GitHub repository as a first portfolio project. To explore the data, utilize knowledge of pandas and Python to create statistical summaries demonstrating differences in those who accepted and rejected the coupon. Utilize the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create a visualization using Python. Ensure that the findings are clearly stated in a separate section alongside actionable items and recommendations.
